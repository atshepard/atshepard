### Hi! I'm Ashlyn - an enthusiastic engineer with an insatiable curiosity!

<!--
**atshepard/atshepard** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app to help van-lifers, nomads and others who live alternative lifestyles stay safe while on the road.
- 💬 Ask me about my Dungeons and Dragons campaign...
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atshepard/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: All my pets are named after Greek myths, which is a special love of mine (I studied Classics in college).


- ⬇️ Just below you'll find some of my favorite recent projects: my solo work is on the left, group work on the right! All of these, with the exception of project kain, are the result of 2 day code sprints.
