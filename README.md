### Hi! I'm Ashlyn - an enthusiastic engineer with an insatiable curiosity!

<!--
**atshepard/atshepard** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to help van-lifers and other nomads who live alternative lifestyles stay safe while on the road.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Dungeons and Dragons campaign...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atshepard/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: All my pets are named after Greek myths, which is a special love of mine (I studied Classics in college).


- Right below you'll find some of my favorite public projects: my solo work is on the left, group work on the right!
